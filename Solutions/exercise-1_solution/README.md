# Fetch

Practice using **fetch** to request data!

## Instructions

### Part 1

1. Create a simple HTML page containing an **input field, a button, and a div**.

### Part 2

2. Use **fetch** in your `index.js` file to get the following functionality. You can use **either** traditional "Promise" syntax (with .then() handlers) **or** `async await` syntax, depending on your preference.

    >- You have one text file in your exercise repo, called `data.txt`
    >- If you type "data.txt" into the input, and click the button, the contents of the `data.txt` file will populate the `<div>` element.
    >- If you type anything else into the input and click the button, the string: "Sorry, file not found!" will populate the `<div>` element.

### Bonus

3. If you have some extra time at the end, try to style your page to make it look nicer. :-)
